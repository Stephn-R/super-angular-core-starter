# Angular2.Core v1.1.0

A successful marriage of Webpack, Angular2, and .NET Core

#### Notes

- This application does not use the SystemJS implementation of Angular 2
- Webpack Middleware is used to compile the code live in dev mode
- Client/ contains all the Angular 2 code
- Server/ contains all the .NET Core code
- Angular2 is used here with redux, redux-router, and more.
